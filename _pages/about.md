I am a PhD candidate funded by EPSRC, working on Deep Learning for Remote Sensing systems at the [University of Sussex](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p188305-georgios-voulgaris). My research focuses on extracting salient feature representations for domain adaptation and semantic segmentation tasks. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning and Computer Vision. My goal is to develop novel Deep Learning models that can provide tools for meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) objectives.

Being part of the Predictive Analytical Lab (PAL) – an interdisciplinary research team, I have been involved in a British Academy funded project focused on Satellite/Aerial Image Scene Segmentation, where I designed novel Deep Learning models that classify land use from satellite/aerial images. For more details please see: - [PAL](https://wearepal.ai/projects/ssrp). The aim of the project is to apply deep learning techniques, to map peri-urban agriculture in Ghaziabad India, and research ways of integrating multiple types of data through a web-based mapping and visualisation tool. This project contributes to the [SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11). Please see the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFC0Z3B0lzY) below.

Currently, I am developing a novel architecture that extracts salient features whilst capturing more context and spatial image information by employing a wider receptive field, thus enhancing semantic segmentation performance in aerial images. The proposed approach is resilient to shadows and effectively retrieves scene information that is hidden beneath canopy. Additionally, it is efficient in detecting water bodies (lakes, rivers) from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and compared to the current state of the art, the proposed model is particularly effective in segmenting water bodies from snow and ice. This project contributes to the [SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6).

Furthermore, I have recently investigated the Deep Learning robustness to domain shifts due to seasonal variations and proposed a novel architecture that extracts invariant feature representations between domains by combining salient texture feature extraction and a wider receptive field. This makes the model robust in the presence of domain shifts due to seasonal variations. This project contributes to the [SDG 13: Climate Action](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13).

During my research internship at Satellite Applications Catapult, I applied physics aware AI and Remote Sensing data to detect and classify cement plants in China by exploiting physical properties such as plant surrounding temperature and soil moisture. This project contributes to the [SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9). Some of the main features of this project are:

• Employing Landsat-8 remote sensors (Thermal Infrared and Operational Land Imager) to create datasets comprised of thermal infrared (bands 10 and 11), short wave infrared (bands 6 and 7), and a geological ratio of the short-wave infrared image chips of two classes (cement plants and the surrounding land cover).

• Training and validating various state of the art deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet) on the created datasets.

Prior my PhD, I worked as a Control and Automation Design Engineer for the oil and gas industry, where I was exposed to the full software and hardware life cycle, systems sensing and control, communications, functional safety, project planning and management.

I am always up for new collaborations, drop me an email if you want to chat!
