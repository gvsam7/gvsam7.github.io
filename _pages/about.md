I am a [Postdoctoral researcher](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/georgios-voulgaris) in Deep Learning and Computer Vision at the University of Oxford, working with [Prof Ben Sheldon](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-ben-sheldon). My research focuses on developing innovative Deep Learning models to advance feature representation learning — particularly for salient feature extraction in complex, densely populated scenes. Additionally, I investigate multimodal deep learning and data fusion techniques, exploring how combining diverse data sources — such as RGB, hyperspectral, and thermal imagery — can improve model generalisation across domains. My work bridges theoretical advancements in deep learning with practical applications in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and industrial scene analysis.

<!-- Part of my research creating high-quality datasets tailored for classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks, enabling robust and scalable solutions across diverse domains. -->

<!-- My research aims to improve feature representation learning in deep networks, focusing on salient feature extraction for segmentation tasks in dense scenes. My work bridges theoretical advancements in feature representation learning with practical applications in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and industrial scene understanding.-->

Prior to this, I completed an EPSRC-funded PhD at the University of Sussex, where I focused on deep learning and computer vision for remote sensing systems. Under the supervision of [Prof. Andy Philippides](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p23611-andy-philippides) and [Prof. Novi Quadrianto](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p335583-novi-quadrianto), my research involved developing novel models for salient feature representation in domain adaptation and semantic segmentation tasks.

As part of the [Predictive Analytics Lab](https://wearepal.ai/) (PAL), I contributed to a [British Academy funded project on Satellite/Aerial Image Scene Segmentation](https://wearepal.ai/projects/ssrp). I designed innovative deep learning models to classify land use from imagery, focusing on mapping peri-urban agriculture in Ghaziabad, India. The project integrated multiple data types into a web-based mapping and visualisation tool to enhance understanding of land use patterns. Please see the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFC0Z3B0lzY) below.
<!-- Being part of the [Predictive Analytics Lab](https://wearepal.ai/) (PAL) – an interdisciplinary research team, I was involved in a British Academy funded project focused on Satellite/Aerial Image Scene Segmentation, where I designed novel Deep Learning models that classify land use from satellite/aerial images. For more details please see: - [PAL](https://wearepal.ai/projects/ssrp). The aim of the project was to apply deep learning techniques, to map peri-urban agriculture in Ghaziabad India, and research ways of integrating multiple types of data through a web-based mapping and visualisation tool. This project contributed to the [SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11). Please see the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFC0Z3B0lzY) below.-->

Currently, I am developing a novel semantic segmentation architecture with a custom convolutional layer that enhances feature extraction in complex aerial scenes, alongside a hybrid CNN-Transformer model that outperforms existing Transformer-based methods.

My ongoing research includes:
*	A mid-level data fusion model for cement plant detection using multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite data.
*	Robust segmentation models for UAV-based waterbody detection that overcome occlusion and shadowing challenges.
*	Solutions addressing deep learning robustness to seasonal domain shifts through invariant feature representation.

To support these efforts, I curate high-quality datasets for various computer vision tasks across diverse environments.

During my research internship at Satellite Applications Catapult (supervised by [Dr Cristian Rossi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590354100)), I applied physics-aware AI and remote sensing data to detect and classify cement plants in China by leveraging physical properties such as ambient temperature and soil moisture. <!-- This project contributes to the [SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9). -->

Prior my PhD, I worked as a Control and Automation Design Engineer in the oil and gas industry, gaining experience across the full software and hardware development lifecycle — including systems sensing and control, communication protocols, functional safety, and project planning.

I am always open to new collaborations — feel free to get in touch if you would like to chat!
