## Domain Adaptation
_____
These works provide an overview of my research on domain shifts in aerial scenes due to seasonal variations between wet and dry seasons in the Global South. The aim of this work is to perform an aerial scene analysis and investigate which features Deep Learning models rely on when classifying aerial scenes. Based on the findings, we propose Deep Learning architectures that extract invariant feature representations across wet and dry season domains.
